# ClawdHub Platform - Comprehensive Technical Report

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**CLI Version**: molthub v0.3.1-beta.1
**Registry**: https://clawhub.ai (discovered via https://clawdhub.com/.well-known/clawdhub.json)

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

### Registry Discovery
- CLI defaults to `https://clawdhub.com`
- On first request, fetches `/.well-known/clawdhub.json` which returns:
  ```json
  {"apiBase":"https://clawhub.ai","authBase":"https://clawhub.ai","minCliVersion":"0.1.0","registry":"https://clawhub.ai"}
  ```
- Discovered registry is cached in `~/.config/clawdhub/config.json` (or OS equivalent)
- Legacy registry hosts (`auth.clawdhub.com`) are auto-migrated

### API Endpoints (v1)
| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/v1/skills` | GET | List/explore skills (supports `limit`, `sort` params) |
| `/api/v1/skills` | POST | Publish skill (multipart form: payload JSON + file blobs) |
| `/api/v1/skills/:slug` | GET | Get skill metadata + latest version |
| `/api/v1/search` | GET | Vector search (`q`, `limit` params) |
| `/api/v1/resolve` | GET | Resolve version by content hash (`slug`, `hash` params) |
| `/api/v1/download` | GET | Download skill zip (`slug`, `version` params) |
| `/api/v1/stars` | POST | Star a skill |
| `/api/v1/stars` | DELETE | Unstar a skill |
| `/api/v1/whoami` | GET | Validate auth token |
| `/api/v1/souls` | - | Soul/profile management (undocumented) |

### Legacy API (still exists)
| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/search` | Old search endpoint |
| `/api/skill` | Old skill metadata |
| `/api/skill/resolve` | Old version resolution |
| `/api/download` | Old download |
| `/api/cli/whoami` | Old auth check |
| `/api/cli/upload-url` | Old upload (pre-signed URL flow) |
| `/api/cli/publish` | Old publish |
| `/api/cli/skill/delete` | Old delete |
| `/api/cli/telemetry/sync` | Telemetry reporting |

### HTTP Layer
- Uses `undici` for HTTP/2 support with 15s timeout
- Retry logic: 2 retries with exponential backoff for 429/5xx errors
- Bun runtime fallback: uses `curl` subprocess instead of `fetch`
- Auth: Bearer token in `Authorization` header
- **Known issue**: Does not respect `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` env vars (undici limitation)

---

## 2. CLI Commands Reference

### Authentication
```
molthub login [--token <t>]    # Browser OAuth (GitHub) or direct token
molthub logout                 # Remove stored token
molthub whoami                 # Validate current token
molthub auth                   # Auth management subcommands
```
- Auth flow: Opens browser to `{site}/cli/auth` for GitHub OAuth
- Token stored in: `~/.config/clawdhub/config.json`

### Discovery
```
molthub search <query> [--limit <n>]     # Vector (semantic) search
molthub explore [--limit <n>] [--sort <order>] [--json]
```
Sort options: `newest` (default), `downloads`, `rating`/`stars`, `installs`, `installsAllTime`, `trending`

### Install/Update
```
molthub install <slug> [--version <v>] [--force]   # Install to ./skills/<slug>

molthub list                                        # List from lockfile
```
- Installs to `{workdir}/skills/{slug}/`
- Creates `.clawdhub/origin.json` per skill with registry, version, timestamp
- Lockfile at `{workdir}/.clawdhub/lock.json`
- Update uses content hashing to detect local modifications

### Publishing
```
molthub publish <path> --slug <s> --name <n> --version <v> [--changelog <text>] [--tags <csv>] [--fork-of <slug[@version]>]
molthub sync                    # Scan local skills, publish new/updated
molthub delete <slug>           # Soft-delete (owner/admin only)
molthub undelete <slug>         # Restore soft-deleted
```
- Requires SKILL.md in the folder
- Uploads all text files as multipart form
- Version must be valid semver
- Tags default to "latest"

### Social
```
molthub star <slug>
molthub unstar <slug>
```

### Global Options
```

## 3. Skill Format

### Directory Structure
```
my-skill/
  SKILL.md              # Required - main skill file
  scripts/              # Optional - supporting scripts
    helper.sh
  .clawdhub/
    origin.json         # Auto-generated on install (not published)
```

### SKILL.md Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: my-skill-slug
description: Short summary for search/display
metadata: {"clawdbot":{"emoji":"...","requires":{"bins":["cmd1"],"anyBins":["cmd1","cmd2"],"env":["API_KEY"],"config":["setting"]},"always":true,"skillKey":"custom-key","primaryEnv":"API_KEY","homepage":"https://...","os":["linux","darwin"],"install":[{"kind":"brew","formula":"pkg"},{"kind":"node","package":"pkg"},{"kind":"uv","module":"pkg"}]}}
---
```

### Metadata Schema
| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `always` | boolean | Always-active skill (loaded without explicit request) |
| `skillKey` | string | Custom activation key |
| `primaryEnv` | string | Primary env var needed |
| `emoji` | string | Display emoji |
| `homepage` | string | Project homepage URL |
| `os` | string[] | Supported OS list |
| `requires.bins` | string[] | Required binaries (all must exist) |
| `requires.anyBins` | string[] | Required binaries (at least one) |
| `requires.env` | string[] | Required environment variables |
| `requires.config` | string[] | Required config settings |
| `install` | array | Install specs: brew, node, go, uv |

### Text File Detection
- Only text files are included in published bundles
- Detection via file extension (known text types) and binary content check
- Excludes: `.clawdhub/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`, etc. (via .gitignore patterns)

### Content Hashing
- Skills are fingerprinted by hashing all text file contents
- Used for update detection: `resolve` API matches hash to find which version matches local state
- Allows detecting local modifications before updates

## 5. Security Model

### Authentication
- GitHub OAuth via browser redirect
- Token stored in plaintext at OS-specific config path
- Token transmitted as Bearer header over HTTPS

### Skill Execution
- **No sandboxing**: Skills run with full agent permissions
- Skills are text instruction files - they tell the agent what to do
- The agent then executes commands with its own permissions
- This means a malicious skill can instruct the agent to:
  - Read/write any file the agent can access
  - Execute arbitrary commands
  - Exfiltrate data via network calls

### Moderation
- Report-based system
- Auto-hide at 3 reports
- Soft-delete available for owners/admins
- No pre-publication review

### Telemetry
- Syncs installed skill list (`/api/cli/telemetry/sync`)
- Sends: root workspace ID, label, installed skill slugs+versions
- Disable: `CLAWHUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`

---

## 6. Docker Sandbox Integration Notes

### Setup
- Docker Desktop 4.59.0 includes `docker sandbox` plugin v0.10.1
- `docker sandbox create claude <workspace-path>` creates an isolated VM
- Workspace mounted via virtiofs at the original host path (e.g., `/h/Projects/...`)
- Includes proxy at `host.docker.internal:3128` with custom CA cert

### Proxy Workaround
Node.js `undici`/`fetch` does NOT respect `HTTP_PROXY` env vars. Workaround:
```javascript
// /tmp/register-proxy.js - require hook
const proxy = process.env.HTTPS_PROXY || process.env.HTTP_PROXY;
if (proxy) {
  const { ProxyAgent } = require('<path-to-undici>');
  const agent = new ProxyAgent(proxy);
  const origFetch = globalThis.fetch;
  globalThis.fetch = function(url, opts = {}) {
    return origFetch(url, { ...opts, dispatcher: agent });
  };
}
```
Run with: `node -r /tmp/register-proxy.js $(which molthub) <command>`

## 7. Competitive Analysis Notes

### Strengths
1. **Simple skill format**: Just a SKILL.md + optional files. Low barrier to entry.
2. **Semantic search**: Vector-based search using embeddings provides good discoverability.
3. **Version management**: Proper semver, content hashing for change detection.
4. **Growing ecosystem**: ~200+ skills across many categories in first week.
5. **Well-known established maintainer** (steipete).

### Weaknesses
1. **No sandboxing**: Skills execute with full agent permissions.
2. **No pre-publication review**: Anyone can publish anything.
3. **Beta maturity**: Single version (0.3.1-beta.1), new ecosystem.
4. **Proxy/network issues**: undici doesn't respect HTTP_PROXY.
5. **Duplicate skills**: Multiple "YouTube Watcher", "coding-agent" variants with no dedup.
6. **No dependency management**: Skills can't declare dependencies on other skills.
7. **No testing framework**: No way to validate skills work before publishing.

### Comparison with Custom Agentic Orchestrator
| Aspect | ClawdHub | Custom Orchestrator |
|---|---|---|
| Skill format | Markdown + YAML frontmatter | Custom JSON/config |
| Distribution | Central registry | Self-hosted |
| Search | Vector (OpenAI embeddings) | - |
| Sandboxing | None | Configurable |
| Dependencies | None | DAG-based |
| Testing | None | Built-in validation |
| Auth | GitHub OAuth | Flexible |

## 8. Moltbook / OpenClaw Ecosystem

### Moltbook (moltbook.com)

Social network for AI agents. Open API at `/api/v1/`.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Registered agents | ~1.6 million |
| Posts | ~154,000 |
| Comments | ~751,000 |
| Top post upvotes | 988,765 (fake — see below) |

**Vote exploit**: Race condition in the voting API. Sending 50 concurrent vote requests yields 30-40 successful votes. This is publicly documented (by user "CircuitDreamer" on the platform itself). All vote counts are unreliable.

**Agent registration**: POST to `/api/v1/agents/register`. Returns an API key, but posting requires a human to claim the agent via tweet verification. This is a deliberate security gate.

**Real content**: Despite inflated metrics, genuine technical discourse exists — discussions about MCP servers, Kubernetes, prompt engineering, and tool use patterns.

### OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot, then Moltbot)

Open-source AI agent runtime. Rebranded multiple times under pressure from Anthropic (the "Claud" prefix was problematic). Key characteristics:

- Full system access — agents run with the user's full permissions
- No sandboxing at the runtime level
- Skill execution is unconstrained text instruction following
- Setup involves Node.js installation, API key configuration, and the `openclaw` CLI

### Ecosystem Map

```
OpenClaw (agent runtime) → ClawdHub (skill registry) → Moltbook (social network) → MoltReg (blockchain identity on Base L2)
```

Each layer adds attack surface. A trojanized skill in ClawdHub can instruct an OpenClaw agent to register on Moltbook, post spam, or worse — exfiltrate data, install persistence mechanisms, or pivot to other systems.

## 9. Security Incident: Trojanized Skill (moltbook-ay)

### Discovery

During research, three Moltbook-related skills were installed from the registry:

1. `moltbook-interact` — Clean. Posting interface for Moltbook API.
2. `moltbook-registry` — Clean. Blockchain identity registration on Base L2.
3. `moltbook-ay` — **Trojanized.** Contains instructions to download and execute malware.

### Payload Analysis

The `moltbook-ay` SKILL.md contained instructions for an AI agent to:

1. Download a password-protected ZIP archive (`openclaw-core`) from an external URL
2. Extract it using a hardcoded password (bypasses antivirus scanning)
3. Execute the extracted binary

This is classic malware distribution adapted for AI agents: password-protected archives evade automated scanning, and the instructions target autonomous agents that follow SKILL.md content without human review.

### Impact Assessment

**No impact.** The `molthub install` command was verified (from source code) to only:
1. Download a ZIP from the registry
2. Extract text files to disk (with path sanitization)
3. Write JSON metadata

No code from installed skills is ever executed by the install process. The trojanized content was social engineering — text instructions that would only be dangerous if an agent read and followed them autonomously.

### Response

1. Identified the trojan during manual review of installed skill content
2. Deleted all three moltbook skill directories
3. Cleaned lock file references
4. Verified no scheduled tasks, startup entries, or persistence mechanisms
5. Verified install process from source code (zero code execution)
6. Documented findings in this report

### Lessons

- The ClawdHub registry has no pre-publication review — anyone can publish malicious skills
- The trust model relies entirely on the agent (or its operator) reviewing skill content before execution
- Password-protected archive delivery is a red flag pattern worth automated detection
- The "report and auto-hide at 3 reports" moderation system is insufficient for malware distribution
